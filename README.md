Say Cheers! is an app for sending a virtual 'cheers' to your friends. After signing up for an account, you may say cheers to a friend by typing in their email (assuming they are also a user). If your friend says 'cheers' back to you within a 30 minute window, you have both successfully cheers'd each other and the 'cheers' gets logged in your total cheers in your account.

This app uses a blockchain simulator to record and store each complete 'cheers' transaction, visible here: https://say-cheers-blockchain.herokuapp.com/
